## This Python program reads 20 random integers from a text file. Additionally, it uses modulo to separate the even and odd numbers from the list into separate variables before writing each to a separate file (even and odd txt files).Â The 'with' statement is used by the program to open the "numbers.txt" file in read mode at first, ensuring that the file will be closed properly after it has been read. The string is then converted into an integer by using list comprehension to remove the line break character from each line.
